# Cyber-Security
Here i have created a project based on steganongrpahy. which can be used to hide a secret message in an image, audio or video files to hide from unknown people or criminals. Here i have created  a project to hide a secret message in an image using python. 
Now i will explain the code how it will work.
First we have to create a folder with name "encoded_images" in the location where the python code was saved. There the encoded images will be saved.
while executing the code the we will get a window with two options Encode and Decode.
To hide a text in an image to click on encode  and enter the secret message and select the image file  where you want to hide the text and click submit and the image will be saved in the "encoded_images" folder.
To decode the text from image executre the code again the click on decode and select the encoded file to display the secret message.
The secret message will be displayed on top where the background image is displayed.
Thanking you.
